AB Patterns in pelagic fish spatial distribution have been linked to environmental factors, especially depth and temperature (ocean fronts). This paper explores the relationship between school size, depth, temperature, and location data extracted from a summer 1991 Bering Sea Scientific fisheries acoustic survey, using morphological and other image enhancement techniques. A variety of mapping techniques, scatterplots, and histograms were used to elucidate environment-school relationships. A general regression tool (generalized additive models) then substantiated and tested the significance of these relationships. We found that bottom depth and ocean fronts influence the distribution and dynamics of the (predominantly) pollocks schools. School density (number of schools per unit transect length) and total school area were highest in shallow water either above or below the thermocline, but not both in the same area. School mass was highest for schools below the thermocline and in locations where the thermocline depth is intermediate (37–42 m). Pollock appeared to avoid cold temperatures and remained below the thermocline when mid-water temperatures were below 0°C. Pollock above the thermocline were largely age-0 pollock, while adults predominated below the thermocline, especially in deeper water. We hypothesize that the thermocline serves as an effective barrier in the summer, separating age-0 pollock from potentially cannibalistic adults. We suggest that adult pollock feeding, which occurs mostly during the crepuscular period, depends on diel migration of euphausiids below the thermocline, while younger pollock primarily feed on copepods in the upper water column.

AB Abstract Motivation Impacts of climate change on marine biodiversity are often projected with species distribution modelling using standardized data layers representing physical, chemical and biological conditions of the global ocean. Yet, the available data layers (1) have not been updated to incorporate data of the Sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which comprise the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios; (2) consider a limited number of Earth System Models (ESMs), and (3) miss important variables expected to influence future biodiversity distributions. These limitations might undermine biodiversity impact assessments, by failing to integrate them within the context of the most up-to-date climate change projections, raising the uncertainty in estimates and misinterpreting the exposure of biodiversity to extreme conditions. Here, we provide a significant update of Bio-ORACLE, extending biologically relevant data layers from present-day conditions to the end of the 21st century Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios based on a multi-model ensemble with data from CMIP6. Alongside, we provide R and Python packages for seamless integration in modelling workflows. The data layers aim to enhance the understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on biodiversity and to support well-informed research, conservation and management. Main Types of Variable Contained Surface and benthic layers for, chlorophyll-a, diffuse attenuation coefficient, dissolved iron, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, ocean temperature, pH, phosphate, photosynthetic active radiation, total phytoplankton, total cloud fraction, salinity, silicate, sea-water direction, sea-water velocity, topographic slope, topographic aspect, terrain ruggedness index, topographic position index and bathymetry, and surface layers for air temperature, mixed layer depth, sea-ice cover and sea-ice thickness. Spatial Location and Grain Global at 0.05° resolution. Time Period and Grain Decadal from present-day to the end of the 21st century (2000?2100). Major Taxa and Level of Measurement Marine biodiversity associated with surface and epibenthic habitats. Software Format A package of functions developed for Python and R software.

AB Aim The oceans harbour a great diversity of organisms whose distribution and ecological preferences are often poorly understood. Species distribution modelling (SDM) could improve our knowledge and inform marine ecosystem management and conservation. Although marine environmental data are available from various sources, there are currently no user-friendly, high-resolution global datasets designed for SDM applications. This study aims to fill this gap by assembling a comprehensive, uniform, high-resolution and readily usable package of global environmental rasters. Location Global, marine. Methods We compiled global coverage data, e.g. satellite-based and in situ measured data, representing various aspects of the marine environment relevant for species distributions. Rasters were assembled at a resolution of 5 arcmin (c. 9.2 km) and a uniform landmask was applied. The utility of the dataset was evaluated by maximum entropy SDM of the invasive seaweed Codium fragile ssp. fragile. Results We present Bio-ORACLE (ocean rasters for analysis of climate and environment), a global dataset consisting of 23 geophysical, biotic and climate rasters. This user-friendly data package for marine species distribution modelling is available for download at http://www.bio-oracle.ugent.be. The high predictive power of the distribution model of C. fragile ssp. fragile clearly illustrates the potential of the data package for SDM of shallow-water marine organisms. Main conclusions The availability of this global environmental data package has the potential to stimulate marine SDM. The high predictive success of the presence-only model of a notorious invasive seaweed shows that the information contained in Bio-ORACLE can be informative about marine distributions and permits building highly accurate species distribution models.

AB Although it is known that satellite data are useful for obtaining ice thickness distribution for perennial sea ice or in stable thin sea ice areas, it is still an unresolved issue for the seasonal sea ice zone (SIZ). In this study, we approach the problem of ice thickness retrieval by using L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). In the SIZ, ice thickness growth is closely related to the ridging activity and therefore surface roughness is expected to be correlated with ice thickness. L-band SAR is suitable for detecting such surface roughness, and therefore is expected to be a good tool for obtaining thickness distribution. To verify this idea, we conducted ship-borne electromagnetic (EM) inductive sounding and supersonic profiling observations with an icebreaker, coordinated with airborne L-band SAR observations in the southern Sea of Okhotsk in February 2005. The surface elevation was estimated by representing the ship's motion with a low-pass filter. Backscattering coefficients correlated well with ice thickness and surface roughness, defined by standard deviation of surface elevation. This result sheds light on the possibility of determining ice thickness distribution in the SIZ.

AB Dissolved oxygen (DO) is one of the critical parameters representing water quality in coastal environments. However, it is labor- and cost-intensive to maintain monitoring systems of DO since in situ measurements of DO are needed in high spatial and temporal resolution to establish proper management plans of coastal regions. In this study, we applied statistical analyses between long-term monitoring datasets and satellite remote sensing datasets in the eastern coastal region of the Yellow Sea. Pearson correlation analysis of long-term water quality monitoring datasets shows that water temperature and DO are highly correlated. Stepwise multiple regression analysis among DO and satellite-derived environmental variables shows that the in situ DO can be estimated by the combination of the present sea surface temperature (SST), the chlorophyll-a, and the SST in the month prior. The high skill score of our proposed model to derive DO is validated by two error measures, the Absolute Relative Error, 1-ARE (89.2%), and Index of Agreement, IOA (78.6%). By applying the developed model to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) products, spatial and temporal changes in satellite-derived DO can be observed in Saemangeum offshore in the Yellow Sea. The analysis results show that there is a significant decrease in estimated DO between summer of 2003 versus 2012 indicating summer coastal deoxygenation due probably to the Saemangeum reclamation. This study shows the potential capability of satellite remote sensing in monitoring in situ DO in both high temporal and spatial resolution, which will be beneficial for effective and efficient management of coastal environments.

T2 Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography
AB We synthesize recent research on variation in annual production of copepods (Calanus spp.), euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.), and juvenile walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) in the southeastern Bering Sea. We reach five conclusions: 1) the timing of the spring bloom is more important than the amount of annual primary production for the transfer of primary to secondary production (i.e., timing matters); 2) summer and fall, not just spring, matter: organisms must maximize energy intake devoted to somatic growth and storage of lipids and minimize energy expenditures during each season; 3) stored lipids are important for the overwinter survival of both zooplankton and age-0 walleye pollock; 4) variation in ice extent and timing of ice retreat affect the spatial distributions of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and age-0 walleye pollock; when these spatial distributions match in late-ice-retreat years, the annual production of copepods, euphausiids, and juvenile walleye pollock often increases (i.e., location matters); 5) if years with late ice retreat, which favor copepod, euphausiid, and juvenile walleye pollock production, occur in succession, top–down control increases. These conclusions help to explain annual variation in production of copepods, euphausiids and juvenile walleye pollock. Copepods and euphausiids often are more abundant in cold years with late ice retreat than in warm years with early ice retreat due to bloom timing and the availability of ice algae during years with late ice retreat. As a consequence, age-0 walleye pollock consume lipid-enriched prey in cold years, better preparing them for their first winter and their overwinter survival is greater. In addition, there is a spatial match of primary production, zooplankton, and age-0 walleye pollock in cold years and a mismatch in warm years.

T2 Progress in Oceanography
AB Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) is a commercially important marine fish in the Gulf of Alaska that has provided a natural experimental system to study many features of the recruitment process. We review recruitment of pollock in the Gulf of Alaska in the conceptual framework of a complex system. In this perspective, high frequency, or activating, events during egg and larval life introduce variability to the dynamics of the population, whereas lower frequency constraining processes tend to promote broader patterns. This view is supported by both simple population and complex statistical models that capture the trends and general patterns in the time series of recruitment. Consequences of this view of recruitment are discussed in terms of forecasting strategies.

T2 ICES Journal of Marine Science
AB Pfeiffer, L., and Haynie, A. C. 2012. The effect of decreasing seasonal sea-ice cover on the winter Bering Sea pollock fishery. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: .The winter fishing season for eastern Bering Sea pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) is during the period of maximum seasonal sea-ice extent, but harvesters avoid fishing in ice-covered waters. Global climate models predict a 40% reduction in winter ice cover by 2050, with potential implications for the costs incurred by vessels travelling to and around their fishing grounds and the value of their catch. Additionally, it may open entirely new areas to fishing. Using retrospective data from 1999 to 2009, a period of extensive annual climate variation, the variation in important characteristics of the fishery is analysed. When ice is present, it restricts a portion of the fishing grounds, but in general, ice-restricted areas have lower expected profits at the time of restriction than the areas left open. Some areas show a change in effort in warm years relative to cold, but the global redistribution of effort attributable to ice cover is small. This is largely because the winter fishery is driven by the pursuit of roe-bearing fish whose spawning location is stable in the southern part of the fishing grounds.
