# GEOG463-563-Project
Repository for work and code for GEOG463/563 project on pollock modeling and impacts

Correlation of pollock catch per unit effort (CPUE) to environmental factors off current pollock trawls (via machine learning?). By then giving this model future ocean conditions we aim to predict pollock CPUE under various climate predictions.
