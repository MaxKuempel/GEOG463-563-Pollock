# GEOG463-563-Project
Repository for work and code for GEOG463/563 project on pollock modeling and impacts

Correlation of pollock catch per unit effort (CPUE) to environmental factors off current pollock trawls (via machine learning?). By then giving this model future ocean conditions we aim to predict pollock CPUE under various climate predictions.


- Coding challenge: develop R code to simulate a Lotka-volterra predator-prey system. Use forward Euler integration, which is basically a for-loop, to simulate changes in the predator and prey populations over time. Save population time series as separate csv files. Then develop a separate R-script for plotting these time series. Save these plots as PNG figures.
Create a GitHub repo for this coding challenge, and make the README.md, and embed these figures. Try to include a description of the equations that you just solved using R.
